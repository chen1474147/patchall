# patchall

my ubuntu user name is administrator, maybe you need to change to your name.

To use this code, you should build opencv in ubuntu and set it in eclipse. 

After this, you need to put the segmentation files in a directory, for example, the harvestInput directory.

Then, you need to build a directory named patchmatch in your Desktop, and move the harvestInput in it.

Then you just need to tun, and at last, the code will generate a *.tar.gz.
